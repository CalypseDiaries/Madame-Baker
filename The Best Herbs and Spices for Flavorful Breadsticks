Because bland breadsticks are a crime against carbs.
Let’s be honest: no one gets excited about plain breadsticks. They’re like that one friend who’s nice but never brings anything to the party. But toss in the right herbs and spices? Suddenly they’re the life of the dinner table—bold, irresistible, and the first thing to disappear from the basket.
Whether you’re baking from scratch or upgrading a store-bought batch, here are the MVPs (Most Valuable Plant-based Seasonings) that’ll take your breadsticks from meh to more, please.

1. Garlic Powder – The OG Flavor Bomb
You can’t talk about savory breadsticks without giving garlic its flowers. Garlic powder brings that warm, punchy flavor without the burn of raw garlic. Pro tip: mix it into the dough and sprinkle some on top before baking for double the deliciousness.
Try it with: Parmesan and olive oil for that classic Italian breadstick vibe.

2. Oregano – A Taste of the Mediterranean
Oregano is like pizza’s secret sauce—it gives your breadsticks that cozy, herby flavor that screams comfort. A little goes a long way, but don’t be shy if you want that pizzeria aroma wafting through your kitchen.
Bonus tip: Combine it with garlic and crushed red pepper for a spicy-savory blend.

3. Rosemary – Earthy and Fancy (In a Good Way)
Fresh or dried, rosemary brings a woodsy, slightly piney flavor that instantly levels up your bread game. It’s the herb equivalent of adding a leather jacket to your outfit—cool without even trying.
Breadstick glow-up: Add a sprinkle of sea salt and a brush of butter to make it pop.

4. Basil – The Soft-Spoken Star
Basil is like the best supporting actor—it doesn’t steal the show but makes everyone else shine. Use dried basil for a mellow, slightly sweet undertone that plays nicely with other herbs like oregano or thyme.
Pro move: Pair with sundried tomatoes or mozzarella for a Caprese-inspired twist.

5. Crushed Red Pepper Flakes – For the Heat Seekers
Want to give your breadsticks a little attitude? A pinch of red pepper flakes adds just enough kick to wake up your taste buds without setting off the fire alarm.
Tip: Combine with a honey butter glaze if you’re into that sweet-spicy combo (which, let’s be honest, is chef’s kiss).

6. Thyme – The Underrated Hero
Thyme has that subtle lemony-peppery thing going on. It’s perfect if you want something a little more refined but still super flavorful. Great in fall recipes, but honestly, it deserves year-round love.
Flavor pairing: Mix with sage and parmesan for a Thanksgiving-in-a-breadstick vibe.

7. Everything Bagel Seasoning – For Max Crunch and Wow
Okay, so this one’s a mix, but it deserves a spot on the list. Sesame seeds, poppy seeds, dried onion, garlic, salt—it’s a flavor party in one shake. If you want your breadsticks to be the talk of the table, just coat them in this magical mix.
Lazy genius tip: Brush breadsticks with egg wash or olive oil before sprinkling so it all sticks.

Final Thoughts
Breadsticks are basically edible paintbrushes—and herbs and spices are your palette. So experiment, taste as you go, and don’t be afraid to get creative. You can even make a breadstick bar (yes, that’s a thing) with dipping sauces and different flavor profiles.
Because life’s too short for boring bread.
