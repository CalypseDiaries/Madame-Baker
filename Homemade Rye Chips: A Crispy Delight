Rye chips are a popular snack, often found in snack mixes or sold as standalone treats by some of the best rye chip brands. These crunchy, flavorful bites are beloved for their robust, slightly tangy taste, which pairs perfectly with dips or stands strong on their own. But did you know that making rye chips at home is surprisingly easy? Not only can you control the flavor and quality of ingredients, but you’ll also enjoy the satisfaction of creating a snack that rivals even the top store-bought options.

In this post, we’ll guide you through a simple recipe for homemade rye chips, from selecting the perfect bread to achieving that signature crispy texture. Let’s dive in!

Ingredients You'll Need
To make rye chips, you’ll need just a handful of ingredients:

Rye bread: Opt for a dense, high-quality loaf. Dark rye or pumpernickel bread works particularly well.
Olive oil: Adds a slight richness and helps the chips crisp up in the oven.
Seasonings: A mix of garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and a pinch of black pepper creates a classic savory flavor. Feel free to get creative with herbs like rosemary or thyme.
Step-by-Step Recipe
Preheat the Oven: Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.
Slice the Bread: Using a sharp knife, slice the rye bread into thin, uniform pieces. Aim for about 1/8-inch thickness to ensure even baking. If you prefer bite-sized chips, cut the slices into smaller squares or triangles.
Season the Chips: In a large mixing bowl, toss the bread slices with olive oil until they’re lightly coated. Sprinkle the seasonings over the bread, tossing again to distribute the flavors evenly.
Bake: Spread the seasoned bread slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the chips are golden brown and crispy. Keep a close eye on them to prevent burning.
Cool and Serve: Allow the rye chips to cool completely before serving. This helps them achieve maximum crunchiness.
Why Make Rye Chips at Home?
While you can buy delicious options from various rye chip brands, making them at home has its perks. Homemade rye chips are fresher, free from preservatives, and customizable to suit your taste. Want extra garlic? Add more! Prefer a spicy kick? Sprinkle on some cayenne pepper or chili flakes.

Another advantage is cost-effectiveness. A single loaf of rye bread can produce multiple batches of chips, saving you money in the long run. Plus, you’ll reduce food waste if you have leftover bread that’s about to go stale.

Serving Suggestions
Homemade rye chips are incredibly versatile. Pair them with dips like hummus, spinach-artichoke dip, or even a creamy dill sauce. They also make a fantastic accompaniment to cheese boards or charcuterie platters.

Final Thoughts
Making rye chips at home is a simple yet rewarding culinary project. With just a few ingredients and minimal effort, you can create a snack that’s fresher, healthier, and just as tasty—if not more so—than what the best rye chip brands offer. So, grab a loaf of rye bread, fire up your oven, and get ready to enjoy the crunch!
