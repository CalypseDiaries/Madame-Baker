Quick & Easy 30-Minute Breadsticks Recipe
Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional, but delicious!)
1 cup warm water
2 tablespoons olive oil or melted butter
½ teaspoon Italian seasoning (optional, for extra flavor)
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional, but highly recommended!)
For the Topping:
2 tablespoons melted butter
½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon chopped parsley (optional)
Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Preheat & Prepare
Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.
2. Mix the Dry Ingredients
In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, and garlic powder. If you want extra flavor, toss in some Italian seasoning or Parmesan cheese.
3. Add the Wet Ingredients
Pour in warm water and olive oil (or melted butter). Stir everything together until a dough starts to form. It should be soft and slightly sticky, but not wet. If it’s too dry, add a tiny splash of water.
4. Shape the Breadsticks
Lightly flour your hands and divide the dough into 8-10 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a rope about 6 inches long. Place them on your prepared baking sheet, spacing them slightly apart.
5. Bake to Perfection
Pop them into the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until they turn a beautiful golden brown.
6. Make the Buttery Topping
While the breadsticks are baking, melt 2 tablespoons of butter and mix it with garlic powder, salt, and parsley.
7. Brush & Serve
As soon as the breadsticks come out of the oven, brush them generously with the buttery topping. If you’re feeling fancy, sprinkle a little more Parmesan on top.
8. Enjoy!
Let them cool for a minute (if you can wait!) and serve warm with marinara sauce, ranch, or your favorite dip.
