Breadsticks are the ultimate comfort food—crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and perfect for dipping. But if you’re vegan (or just avoiding dairy and eggs), you might be wondering how to make them without compromising on flavor and texture. The good news? It’s super easy!

In this blog post, we’ll go over why traditional breadsticks include dairy and eggs (hint: they don’t always have to!), how to replace those ingredients, and provide two foolproof vegan breadstick recipes that will have your kitchen smelling like a cozy Italian bakery.

Why Do Some Breadsticks Contain Dairy or Eggs?
Classic Italian-style breadsticks, also known as grissini, are usually vegan by default—just flour, water, yeast, salt, and olive oil. However, many American-style breadsticks, especially the soft, buttery ones served at restaurants, contain milk, butter, or eggs for extra richness.
Luckily, there are simple vegan swaps that create the same texture and flavor without animal products. Let’s dive in!

Key Vegan Ingredients for Breadsticks
Instead of dairy and eggs, we’ll use these plant-based alternatives:
Olive oil or vegan butter – For a rich, buttery taste
Unsweetened plant milk – Almond, oat, or soy milk adds moisture
Aquafaba (chickpea water) or flax eggs – Helps bind the dough if needed
Nutritional yeast & garlic powder – Adds cheesy, umami goodness

Now, let’s get baking!

Recipe #1: Classic Crispy Vegan Breadsticks
If you love thin, crunchy breadsticks (grissini), this recipe is for you. Perfect for dipping in hummus, marinara, or enjoying with a charcuterie board!
Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
¾ teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon instant yeast
½ cup warm water
2 tablespoons olive oil
½ teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
½ teaspoon dried oregano (optional)

Instructions:
Activate the yeast: In a small bowl, mix warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.
Make the dough: In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, olive oil, and yeast mixture. Mix until it forms a dough. Knead for about 5 minutes until smooth.
Rise: Cover and let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until doubled in size.
Shape the breadsticks: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the dough into a thin sheet and cut into strips. Twist them slightly for extra texture.
Bake: Place on a lined baking sheet and bake for 12–15 minutes, until golden brown.
Cool & enjoy: Let them cool slightly before serving.

Recipe #2: Soft, Garlic-Butter Vegan Breadsticks
These soft, fluffy breadsticks are restaurant-worthy—minus the dairy!
Ingredients:
2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon instant yeast
¾ cup warm unsweetened almond or oat milk
3 tablespoons olive oil (plus extra for brushing)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (for a cheesy taste)
1 tablespoon chopped parsley (optional)

Instructions:
Prepare the dough: In a bowl, combine warm plant milk, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 10 minutes until foamy.
Mix & knead: In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Knead for 8–10 minutes until soft and smooth.
Let it rise: Cover and let the dough rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled.
Shape the breadsticks: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll dough into a rectangle and cut into 8–10 strips. Roll each strip slightly for a smooth shape.
Bake: Place the breadsticks on a lined baking sheet and bake for 12–15 minutes.
Garlic butter glaze: While baking, mix olive oil, minced garlic, and nutritional yeast in a small bowl. Brush over the warm breadsticks when they come out of the oven.
Serve & enjoy! These are best eaten warm with marinara or vegan cheese sauce.

Tips for Perfect Vegan Breadsticks
For extra crunch, bake for an additional 3–5 minutes.
To make them cheesy, sprinkle with vegan Parmesan or more nutritional yeast.
Storage: Keep leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze for later.

Final Thoughts
Vegan breadsticks are just as delicious as traditional ones—if not better! Whether you like them crispy or soft, these recipes prove you don’t need dairy or eggs to create restaurant-quality breadsticks at home.
