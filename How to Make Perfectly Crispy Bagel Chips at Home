Bagel chips are the ultimate crunchy snack—light, crisp, and packed with flavor. Whether you’re looking for a way to use up leftover bagels or just craving a delicious, homemade snack, making bagel chips at home is simple and rewarding. In this guide, we’ll show you how to make perfectly crispy bagel chips with just a few ingredients and some easy steps.
Why Make Your Own Bagel Chips?
Store-bought bagel chips can be pricey, and they often contain preservatives or excessive salt. By making them yourself, you have full control over the flavors, seasonings, and crispiness. Plus, it’s a fantastic way to reduce food waste if you have extra bagels that are starting to go stale.
What You’ll Need
Before you get started, gather the following ingredients:
Ingredients:
2 to 3 bagels (any type—plain, everything, sesame, or whole wheat all work well)
2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil or melted butter
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon garlic powder (optional, for extra flavor)
½ teaspoon onion powder (optional)
½ teaspoon Italian seasoning or dried herbs (optional)
½ teaspoon black pepper (optional, for a little kick)
Equipment:
Sharp serrated knife
Baking sheet
Parchment paper or silicone baking mat
Mixing bowl
Pastry brush or spoon
Step-by-Step Guide to Making Bagel Chips
1. Preheat the Oven
Set your oven to 325°F (163°C). A moderate temperature ensures the bagel chips crisp up evenly without burning.
2. Slice the Bagels Thinly
Using a sharp serrated knife, slice the bagels into thin rounds or half-moons, about ⅛ to ¼ inch thick. The thinner they are, the crispier they’ll be. Try to keep the slices uniform for even baking.
3. Season the Chips
Place the sliced bagels into a mixing bowl. Drizzle them with olive oil or melted butter and toss to coat evenly. Sprinkle salt and any optional seasonings over the chips and mix well.
4. Arrange on a Baking Sheet
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Spread the bagel slices in a single layer, ensuring they don’t overlap. This allows for even baking and maximum crispiness.
5. Bake Until Golden and Crisp
Bake the bagel chips for 15 to 20 minutes, flipping them halfway through. Keep an eye on them—thinner slices may crisp up faster. They should be golden brown and crunchy when done.
6. Cool and Enjoy
Once the chips are crispy, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely. They’ll continue to crisp up as they cool.
Flavor Variations
Want to get creative? Here are some fun ways to add variety to your homemade bagel chips:
Parmesan Herb – Sprinkle grated Parmesan and Italian seasoning before baking.
Cinnamon Sugar – Toss with melted butter, cinnamon, and sugar for a sweet treat.
Everything Seasoning – Coat with everything bagel seasoning for extra crunch and flavor.
Spicy Kick – Add a dash of cayenne or red pepper flakes for some heat.
