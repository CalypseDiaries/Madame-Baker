Not the basic, store-bought, air-filled-bag kind of snacks. I’m talking about the kind that crunch just right, have that salty-savory kick, and make you feel like a snacking genius. Enter: rye bread chips.
If you’ve never had them, imagine the love child of croutons and potato chips—but, you know, with way more flavor and a rustic charm. Once you try them, you’ll never look at a loaf of rye the same way again.
But the real question is: how do you make them perfectly crunchy every single time?
Glad you asked.

First: Start With the Right Bread
Not all rye bread is created equal. For chip-making magic, go for a dense, seedy, slightly dry rye loaf. The kind that’s hearty, dark, and full of character. Bonus points if it’s a couple of days old—drier bread = better crunch. Soft, spongy sandwich rye? Nah. Save that for grilled cheese.

The Slice Game Is Key
Slice your rye thin. Like, almost see-through but not falling apart thin. We're talking ⅛ inch or less. If you slice it too thick, you'll end up with chewy middles. Too thin, and they'll burn in the oven. A serrated bread knife works great here—or a mandoline if you’re feeling fancy and brave.

Oil + Seasoning = Flavor Bomb
This is where you get to play.
In a bowl, mix a few tablespoons of olive oil (or melted butter if you want to live a little) with your favorite seasonings. Here's a simple go-to blend:
A generous pinch of garlic powder
A dash of onion powder
Cracked black pepper
Paprika (for color and a little warmth)
A bit of salt (don’t skip this—it brings it all together)
Toss your rye slices in this flavorful oil bath until they're well-coated but not dripping. Think “lightly dressed,” not “drenched.”

Bake Low and Slow (But Not Too Slow)
Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). Spread your slices on a baking sheet in a single layer—don’t crowd them! They need their space to get crispy.
Bake for about 12-15 minutes, flipping halfway through. Keep an eye on them during the last few minutes—they go from perfect to burnt faster than you can say “snack attack.”
Pro tip: Leave the chips on the tray after turning off the oven, door slightly ajar, for 5-10 minutes. They’ll crisp up even more without overcooking.

Let Them Cool (Seriously)
It’s tempting to dive in right away, but give them a few minutes to cool. This is when they go from “kinda crunchy” to “wow, did I just buy these from a gourmet deli?”
Once cool, store them in an airtight container—if they last that long.

Bonus: Dip It Good
These chips are amazing on their own, but pair them with something creamy and you’re in next-level territory. Try:
Cream cheese + herbs
Hummus
Spinach-artichoke dip
Smoked salmon spread (yep, we went there)

Final Thoughts
Rye bread chips are the kind of snack that makes you feel like you’ve got your life together—even if you just made them because your bread was going stale. They’re easy, insanely good, and they impress anyone lucky enough to snag one.
So next time you’ve got a lonely loaf of rye sitting on the counter, don’t toss it. Slice it, season it, bake it, and enjoy your crunchy creation. Just be warned: once you make them, you'll always want a backup loaf in the pantry.
Snack on, my friend.
