What You’ll Need
Before we get into the different flavors, here’s a basic list of ingredients and tools you’ll need:
Ingredients:
Bagels (any type – plain, whole wheat, everything, etc.)
Olive oil or melted butter
Salt (to taste)
Seasonings (see flavor ideas below)
Tools:
Sharp knife or serrated bread knife
Baking sheet
Parchment paper
Mixing bowl
Brush (for oil or butter application)

How to Make DIY Bagel Chips
Step 1: Preheat Your Oven
Set your oven to 325°F (163°C). A lower baking temperature helps dry out the bagel chips without burning them.
Step 2: Slice the Bagels
Use a sharp serrated knife to slice the bagels into thin rounds or half-moon pieces. Aim for ⅛ to ¼-inch thick slices—thinner slices will be crispier, while thicker slices will have a slight chew.
Step 3: Season the Chips
In a mixing bowl, toss the bagel slices with olive oil or melted butter until evenly coated. Then, add your chosen seasonings and mix well.
Step 4: Bake Until Golden
Arrange the seasoned bagel slices in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 12-20 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown and crispy. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning!
Step 5: Cool and Enjoy
Let the bagel chips cool completely before serving. They will crisp up even more as they cool. Store them in an airtight container for up to one week.
