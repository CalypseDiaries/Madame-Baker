Rye chips are a deliciously crunchy, savory snack with a distinct flavor that pairs well with an array of dips and spreads. Whether you’re enjoying them at a casual gathering, as part of a movie night, or as a midday snack, the right pairing can elevate the whole experience. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the best dips and spreads to complement the earthy, slightly sweet flavor of rye chips, and introduce a few rye chip brands that can help you create the ultimate snack experience.

The Charm of Rye Chips
Rye chips have become a popular snack for their robust, hearty taste and satisfying crunch. Made from rye flour, these chips are often seasoned with various herbs and spices, making them an excellent base for pairing with dips. The unique flavor profile of rye chips—earthy, toasted, and a little bit tangy—offers a perfect balance for more indulgent or creamy dips, as well as lighter, tangy spreads.
Several rye chip brands have caught the attention of snack enthusiasts, offering different styles and seasonings. Popular rye chip brands such as Snyder’s of Hanover, Princeton and Stonefire produce chips that range from simple salted to more complex flavored varieties like sourdough and onion, providing a range of options to suit various palates.

Best Dips for Rye Chips
1. Creamy Spinach and Artichoke Dip
A classic creamy dip, spinach and artichoke dip is a fantastic complement to the bold flavor of rye chips. The rich, cheesy base of the dip blends beautifully with the rye’s earthiness, creating a balanced bite that’s both savory and satisfying. The freshness of the spinach and the slight tang from the artichokes add a complexity that pairs perfectly with rye chips. This dip is best served warm, allowing the cheese to melt and enhance the dip’s flavors.
2. Hummus
If you’re looking for a lighter dip, hummus is an excellent choice. The creamy texture of the hummus combined with the subtle flavors of tahini, olive oil, and garlic creates a perfect contrast to the crunchy rye chip. Whether you choose classic, roasted red pepper, or even spicy harissa hummus, the earthy chickpea-based dip complements the rye chips’ flavor, offering a satisfying snack without being too heavy.
3. Guacamole
Guacamole is always a crowd-pleaser and offers a fresh, vibrant flavor that pairs beautifully with rye chips. The creaminess of the avocado, along with the zesty lime and cilantro, enhances the natural flavors of the rye chips. If you prefer a spicier guacamole, adding jalapeños will provide a perfect balance of heat, making for a satisfying snack experience.
4. Cheddar and Jalapeño Dip
For those who like a bit of heat, a cheddar and jalapeño dip will perfectly complement the robust taste of rye chips. The rich, creamy cheddar pairs wonderfully with the spicy kick of jalapeños, creating a bold and flavorful dip that stands up to the strength of rye chips. This combination is ideal for those who enjoy snacking on something with a bit more intensity.
5. Baba Ganoush
For a unique twist, baba ganoush—a smoky, creamy dip made from roasted eggplant—offers a distinct flavor that’s a perfect match for rye chips. The smoky undertones of the eggplant, combined with tahini and garlic, enhance the rye chips’ flavor without overpowering it. The dip’s silky texture contrasts nicely with the crunchy texture of the chips, making for a satisfying and delicious pairing.
6. Sour Cream and Onion Dip
A classic dip that never goes out of style, sour cream and onion dip is a great option for rye chips. The creamy tanginess of the sour cream, along with the savory flavor of the onions, complements the hearty rye chips beautifully. This pairing offers a familiar, comforting snack that is both simple and delicious.

Best Spreads for Rye Chips
If you prefer something spreadable over dippable, several spreads work wonderfully with rye chips. Here are a few options:
1. Cream Cheese and Chive Spread
A creamy, herb-infused spread like cream cheese and chives is another excellent choice to pair with rye chips. The creaminess of the cheese combined with the fresh, oniony taste of chives creates a spread that’s both rich and light. It pairs wonderfully with the rye chips’ toasty flavor, making it a great snack for entertaining.
2. Pimento Cheese
Pimento cheese, a Southern classic, is a tangy, creamy spread that’s perfect for spreading on rye chips. The richness of the cheese, combined with the slight sweetness of pimentos and a little kick from the hot sauce or mustard, adds complexity and flavor that pairs perfectly with the crispy rye chips.
3. Sun-dried Tomato and Olive Tapenade
For a Mediterranean twist, sun-dried tomato and olive tapenade is an exceptional spread. The briny, savory flavors of the olives and the rich, tangy tomatoes provide a bold contrast to the rye chips. The spread’s complexity and vibrant flavors make for a more sophisticated snacking experience.

Choosing the Right Rye Chip Brand
When selecting rye chips, quality and flavor variety are key to a satisfying snack experience. Snyder’s of Hanover offers a variety of seasoned rye chips, including their famous sourdough flavor, which pairs excellently with creamy dips like spinach and artichoke. Princeton rye chips, known for their crispiness and well-balanced seasoning, are also a great choice, especially for dips like hummus and guacamole.
