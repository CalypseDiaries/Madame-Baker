If you’ve ever had a craving for something crunchy, salty, and just a little bit fancy, then rye bread chips are about to be your new obsession. They’re ridiculously easy to make, require just a handful of ingredients, and taste way better than store-bought snacks. Whether you’re looking for a crunchy sidekick to your favorite dip or just need something to munch on, these homemade rye chips will hit the spot.

Why Rye Bread Chips?
First of all, rye bread has a deep, slightly tangy flavor that makes these chips extra delicious. It also crisps up beautifully in the oven, giving you that perfect crunch without needing a deep fryer. Plus, it’s a great way to use up leftover rye bread before it goes stale—because let’s be honest, who actually finishes an entire loaf before it gets dry?
So, let’s get into it!

Ingredients You'll Need
The beauty of this recipe is its simplicity. You only need a few basic ingredients, and you probably already have most of them in your kitchen:
Rye bread (any kind—dark, light, seeded, or unseeded)
Olive oil or melted butter (for extra flavor)
Garlic powder (because garlic makes everything better)
Salt (a must-have for that perfect savory bite)
Black pepper (optional, but adds a nice kick)
Paprika or smoked paprika (for a hint of warmth and color)
Feel free to customize your seasoning! Want a bit of heat? Add some cayenne. Prefer an herby twist? Sprinkle on some dried oregano or thyme.

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Preheat Your Oven
Set your oven to 375°F (190°C). You want a moderately high temperature to get those chips crispy but not burnt.

2. Slice the Bread
Take your rye bread and slice it into thin, even pieces. The thinner you cut them, the crispier they’ll be. If you like a bit more crunch, go for slightly thicker slices. You can cut them into squares, rectangles, or classic triangle chip shapes—whatever suits your vibe.

3. Season the Chips
Place your bread slices in a large bowl or on a baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil or melted butter over them and toss to coat evenly. Then, sprinkle on the salt, garlic powder, black pepper, and paprika. Give them another good toss so the seasoning sticks to every piece.

4. Bake to Perfection
Spread the seasoned bread slices in a single layer on a baking sheet. If they’re overlapping, they won’t crisp up as well. Pop them in the oven and bake for about 10-15 minutes, flipping them halfway through. Keep an eye on them—since they’re thin, they can go from golden perfection to burnt tragedy pretty fast!

5. Cool and Serve
Once they’re golden brown and crispy, take them out and let them cool for a few minutes. They’ll crisp up even more as they cool down.

How to Enjoy Rye Bread Chips
Now that you’ve got a fresh batch of crispy rye chips, it’s time to enjoy them! Here are a few tasty ways to serve them:
With Dips – Pair them with hummus, tzatziki, or a classic spinach and artichoke dip.
Cheese Board Addition – These chips make a perfect crunchy addition to a charcuterie board.
Soup Sidekick – Dunk them into creamy tomato soup or a hearty stew for an extra crunch.

Final Thoughts
Homemade rye bread chips are one of those snacks that make you feel like a kitchen genius with minimal effort. They’re crispy, flavorful, and way better than anything you’d find in a bag at the store. Plus, they’re a great way to cut down on food waste and turn old bread into something seriously delicious.
