Bagel chips are often overlooked as just a simple snack, but these crispy, crunchy bites have the potential to elevate many dishes in surprising and delicious ways. Whether you have store-bought bagel chips or homemade ones from leftover bagels, they can add flavor and texture to both savory and sweet recipes. Let’s go beyond the traditional dipping experience and explore creative ways to use bagel chips in cooking!

1. A Crunchy Alternative to Croutons
One of the easiest ways to use bagel chips in cooking is as a substitute for croutons. Their crispiness and seasoned flavors make them a perfect topping for salads and soups. Simply crush them into smaller pieces and sprinkle them over a classic Caesar salad or a bowl of creamy tomato soup for an added crunch. You can even use them to top baked mac and cheese or casseroles for extra texture.

2. Bagel Chip Breadcrumbs for Coating and Breading
If you need a flavorful breadcrumb alternative, look no further than bagel chips. Because they are already seasoned and toasted, they add a unique crunch to breaded dishes. To make bagel chip breadcrumbs:
Place bagel chips in a food processor and pulse until finely ground.
Use them as a breading for chicken tenders, fish fillets, or even mozzarella sticks.
Mix with Parmesan cheese and herbs for an extra gourmet touch.
The result? A crunchy, flavorful coating that takes your dish to the next level!

3. Savory Stuffing and Casseroles
Bagel chips can replace traditional bread in stuffing recipes, providing a rich texture and unique flavor. Try using them in a Thanksgiving stuffing or a simple baked casserole. Here’s how:
Crush the bagel chips into smaller chunks.
Sauté onions, celery, and garlic in butter.
Mix the sautéed vegetables with the bagel chip pieces, broth, and seasonings.
Bake until golden brown and crispy on top.
This twist on stuffing adds an irresistible crunch and depth of flavor that regular bread just can’t match!

4. A Topping for Baked Dishes
Want to add some crunch to your favorite baked dishes? Bagel chips can be used to create a crispy topping for casseroles, pasta bakes, and even gratins. Just crush them and mix with melted butter or olive oil, then sprinkle over your dish before baking. The chips will form a golden, crunchy crust that makes every bite more satisfying.
Try this on:
Baked mac and cheese
Potato gratin
Green bean casserole

5. Unique Dips and Spreads
Instead of using bagel chips just for dipping, incorporate them directly into your dips! Crushed bagel chips can add a crunchy texture to cheese spreads or hummus. Try mixing them into:
Spinach and artichoke dip for added texture.
A creamy goat cheese spread for an extra crunch.
A homemade tapenade or olive spread for a Mediterranean twist.
For a fun serving idea, use whole bagel chips as mini edible serving cups for dips or spreads at your next gathering.

6. Dessert Ideas: A Sweet Twist on Bagel Chips
While bagel chips are often used in savory dishes, they can also be transformed into a dessert ingredient! Try these creative ideas:
Bagel Chip S’mores: Use sweet cinnamon-sugar bagel chips instead of graham crackers for a twist on classic s’mores.
Bagel Chip Ice Cream Topping: Crushed bagel chips add a crunchy contrast to creamy ice cream.
Bagel Chip Cheesecake Crust: Blend sweet bagel chips with melted butter and use them as a crust for cheesecakes or pies.
These sweet applications turn bagel chips into a unique ingredient for dessert lovers!

7. Thickening Agent for Soups and Sauces
Bagel chips can be used to thicken soups and sauces just like regular bread or crackers. If you have a soup that needs a little more body, toss in some crushed bagel chips and let them soak up the liquid before blending the mixture. They work especially well in creamy soups like:
Tomato basil soup
Roasted butternut squash soup
Clam chowder
Not only do they thicken the dish, but they also add depth of flavor depending on their seasoning.

Final Thoughts: The Many Uses of Bagel Chips
Bagel chips are so much more than just a snack. From crispy toppings to creative desserts, they can enhance a variety of dishes in unexpected ways. So the next time you have extra bagel chips (or leftover bagels that you can turn into chips), think outside the box and experiment with these creative ideas in your cooking!
